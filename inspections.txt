To Do:
- Write the configuration prod/test mechanism
- Simplify Rot13 algorithm code.. mess of + - % and constants

Some notes for verifying the solution:

- No Java IO exceptions leak out of the IO facade layer
- Minimal repetition of the folder names between test and production implementations
- Clarify "Wrap your platform's console and file I/O methods as if each call actually required a dozen lines of code".
  Does that mean "to the using client", or even *in* the implementing facade code?
- Run FindBugs

Later
- Argument checking?
